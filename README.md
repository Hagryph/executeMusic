# executeMusic
A WoW Addon to play in-game tracks and own mp3 files

# General

With this Add-On you can play wow music/sounds and your own tracks on command. You can use for this the command /play [track] or do it from within the ui. You can also use the autoplay function and play random tracks.

It is possible to change the volume of different sound sources or disable/enable them.
For all commands use the /em help command.
It has a miniUi which displays the last track, can stop/pause the music, opens the tracks ui and help ui, can start/shuffle the autoplay, plays next song in autoplay and last song in autoplay, add/remove the current song to/from favorites.
